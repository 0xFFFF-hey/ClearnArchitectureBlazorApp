## Chapter 12: Components
### 1. What Are Components?
  - Components are the smallest units of deployment in a software system.
  - They are typically represented as files (e.g., .jar, .dll, .gem) that can be independently deployed and linked together.
  - Components are the building blocks of a systemâ€™s architecture.
### 2. The Role of Components
  - Components allow for separation of concerns and modularity.
  - They enable teams to work on different parts of the system independently.
  - Components facilitate reusability and maintainability.
